Sprint 2 Project Details
Python Servers:
Created using Python Flask: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/
Send requests using Requests: http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/quickstart/

Definitions:
Android: Android Device running Telepresence App
Cloud (Server): Python Server running on Google Cloud Platform 
Pepper Server: Python Server running on Pepper
Database: Google Cloud Platform mysql database
Security Key: randomly generated string for security

Connection:
Send/receive HTTP requests to communicate between Android, Cloud, Pepper
All data from Android to Pepper or vice versa will go through the Cloud

Authentication and Security:
User account, Username + Password combo
Security Key generation on Pepper or Cloud using random algorithm
Pepperâ€™s Python Server should compare security keys before processing requests
Android must send security key in request requiring authentication

-new Android security key generated on each request?
-ALL security keys need to be hashed before being sent

-If time permits:
Json Web Token: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token
HTTPS

//------------------------------------------------

Database Schema:
Pepper Entity: 
Pepper ID,String, PRIMARY KEY
IP Address, String
Pepper Security Key, String (Hashed)

AuthUsers Entity: 
Pepper ID,String
Username,String
Email,String
Composite Key(Pepper ID,Username)

User Entity: 
Username,String, PRIMARY KEY
Email,String, UNIQUE
Name,String
Password,String
Android Security Key,String (Hashed)

AuthRequest Entity: 
Pepper ID,String
Username,String
Email,String
Composite Key(Pepper ID,Username)

//------------------------------------------------

Device Requirements:
Pepper Tablet:
-show pepper ID
-register new pepper
-approve authorization requests, deauthorize users
-see authorized users
-add/remove users
-get information from Pepper Server
	-make requests to Cloud via Pepper Server

Android App:
-send authorization requests
-add/remove user account
-send requests to Cloud
-able to send requests including:
login, message, photo, reqAuth, deAuth, addUser, removeUser
Note:
-For login, if multiple Pepper IDs returned then ask user to choose one
	-maybe add a way for users to switch which Pepper they are interacting with

Pepper Server:
-send Pepper ID, IP Address, NEW pepper Security Key to Cloud when the app is started
-get information to the Tablet
-send/receive requests from cloud
-able to send requests including:
deAuth, addUser, removeUser, getAuthRequests, authorizeUser, setPepperActive
-able to handle requests including:
message,photo
